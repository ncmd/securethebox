# 7/4
only 1 challenge; 
what if people cheat; talk on reddit about solution
take problems already exist and put it in the platform and not reinventing the wheel;
are people going to grade answer themselves? no; it should be automated scoring
why not have 2 different types of category questions; screening vs onsite
add timer function
crowdsource rating per question; 
before challenge charts; interviewer should have access to all the skills they are grading for; use it as template on how to test candidate; 
pay for automatic grading 

# 7/14
need a way to manage adding challenges (perhaps use code for adding new posts)
need to modify how frontend get challenge 'steps'

# 7/25
when the problem occurred
how the problem happened
what are the current solutions?

# 8/1
include forensics
add in forensic cases that happened in the past
add detection and infrastructure
