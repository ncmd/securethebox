Cost of hiring = (recruiting) + (engineering time for interviews) + (new hire training) + (bonus, relocation, etc)


Recruiting is usually the largest of these expenses. Some companies use external recruiters who charge a fee, typically 20–25% of one year’s salary. Other companies hire an in-house recruiting team to source leads and manage the hiring pipeline, so they need to pay those peoples’ salaries. There will be additional costs to access sourcing platforms like LinkedIn. Often companies use both external recruiters and an internal team. Of course, recruiting costs can vary depending on the specific roles, location, and your company’s reputation.
The next cost is the time your engineering organization spends on phone screens, in-house interviews, attending job fairs, and other hiring tasks.
Ramping up new employees takes months, and may also require significant time from your existing team for mentorship and training. If you are replacing an engineer with years of institutional knowledge, the total time spent replacing them fully may be enormous.
Finally, there may be other costs associated with the hiring package — a signing bonus (often $5-10k), relocation (perhaps $10k), etc.
